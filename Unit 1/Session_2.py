#Q1
#inputs - sentence string var, spilt var, might need another var to join the list back into a string
#output - reverse of a string and have ending words be the beginning

#plan 
# is to split the sentence and make that into a list and then iterate through that list from the end and to go back to the beginning
# and then turn the list back into a string using the join method()

# def reverse_sentence(sentence):
#     spilt = sentence.split()
#     joined = " ".join(spilt[::-1])
#     return joined
    


# sentence = "tubby little cubby all stuffed with fluff"
# print(reverse_sentence(sentence))

# Q2  my solution 




#Q3

#Q4
# Understand:
# Inputs: int num
# Outputs: returns the sum of the int num var 
# Constraints:  none
# Edge Cases: type(num) != int, num < 0
#P - Plan
# Key Idea - I will create a function that will look over each digit in the var and then slice each digit to be able to add them one by one and then return it.
#Steps:
